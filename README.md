# The-Hexxagon-Game

A simple implementation of the Hexxagon game including AI algorithms.
#
The game has two game modes:
1. Single play
2. Multi play
#
Every player has an option of choosing personal character. The game can be saved in any moment during the game independently from the game mode.
The computer uses a non-trivial method for searching the most efficient move for the current situation on the board.
